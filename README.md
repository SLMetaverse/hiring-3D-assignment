# 3D Code Exercise

Write a code that:

- Create  transparent 3D rooms. Room is a cube. Build a pattern of room as in the image below. ![Cube Image](https://github.com/SLMetaverse/hiring-3D-assignment/blob/challenge/example.jpg?raw=true)

- Every wall of a room must be transparent. You must see another room through the wall.

- Move from one room to another. You are only allowed to move from one space to another space. Ex: From room 1 you have only option to move to room 2 and from room 2 only option to move either room 5 or room 3.

- Able to navigate 360 inside a room.

# Notes
- [three.js](https://threejs.org) is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. 
- There are lots of [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes) that can be referenced.
- You are free to use, write your code in any framework.
- Your code should run and should able to see the desired output in 3D view.
