- Every wall of a room must be transparent. You must see another room through the wall.

- Move from one room to another.

# Notes
- [three.js](https://threejs.org) is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL. 
- There are lots of [examples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes) that can be referenced and combined to get this exercise done.
- Create as many files as you need
- Use anything you need from `three.js` library
